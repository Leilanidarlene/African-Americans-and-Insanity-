# Description of Sources Used  

When deciding on this specific topic, I wanted to focus on African American experiences in the United States, hoping to find a clear story about mental illness among the population. When starting my research, I was hit with the fact that a lot of the primary sources available are from white, upper-class men who have a biased view throughout their writing. One thing I tried to do was understand the societal circumstances and how topics were discussed. I used primary sources as a framework, filling in the gaps with secondary sources that I found helpful to continue the story. There is still more work to be done in archives, but I have found that opening a story that is often untold can spark meaningful conversations that are relevant to society today.
