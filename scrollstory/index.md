# African Americans and Insanity in the Late 19th Century 
Black “insanity” post-Civil War emerged when white medical authorities, driven by racism and fears of black freedom, pathologized black life and diagnosed them with madness, leading to institutionalization in segregated, often awful asylums, where labor was used as “treatment”.   


## Before Emancipation

Before the emancipation, pro-slavery physicians, like Samuel Cartwright, believed that African Americans had a disease known as Drapetomania. According to Dr. Samuel Cartwright in Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race, this disease “induces the negro to run away from service, is as much a disease of the mind as any other species of mental alienation, and much more curable”.[^note1] White physicians before emancipation described an enslaved person who ran away as mentally ill, showing the racialization of Psychiatry.

# Post Emancipation 
In the South, after emancipation, there was a rise in African Americans admitted to Southern asylums. Physicians argued that African Americans were becoming ill because of freedom, creating the notion that they could not handle being independent and a citizen, and leading to supposed moral weakness and a greater risk of becoming insane. This led to a large number of admissions to institutions that were often segregated or had a black only ward. One hospital, The Eastern Hospital, located in North Carolina, opened in 1880, and it accommodated African Americans. In the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, Dr. Thomas Mays discusses the influx of black patients. Mays gives us a look into the number of patients, stating, “In December, 377 negroes were admitted.”[^note2] The number is larger than the number the doctor had seen before. Showing us that after the Civil War, there was an influx of African Americans being admitted to institutions. In the same journal, Dr. Mays discusses how, before emancipation, black insanity was better for the population and became prevalent after the war and emancipation. Author and historian Elodie Edwards, in her book Mad with Freedom, describes how white physicians used their scientific authority, “to pathologize behaviors of black patients, whom they saw as indocile, too political or prone to sexual deviance.” [^note3]

Often, White physicians would enact specific symptoms in the recently freed African Americans, especially when discussing the heightened population in asylums. According to the document by Dr. Thomas Mays, he cites the work of another doctor, Dr. W.B. Barnes. Barnes describes the cause of black insanity as "deprivation, exposure, poor hygiene, difficulty of high preservation, and mental anxiety." These symptoms are defined as the result of recent freedom. Arguing that when African Americans were enslaved, the rate of insanity was uncommon compared to freedom. These examples say that free enslaved people are more susceptible to insanity compared to those still enslaved in the South. Further continuing the notion that when enslaved black people are under the confinement of enslavement, they show fewer signs of insanity.

Physicians described symptoms and also diagnosed African Americans after the emancipation. Diagnoses like mania, moral insanity, and dementia are often racially biased and are usually diagnosed mainly in enslaved people. Some of the reasons for these diagnoses are that African Americans are described as childlike, excitable, or idle, leading to these diagnoses.   


## Asylum Conditions
Segregated and primarily black asylums often came with poor conditions and were severely overcrowded. Virginia’s governor accepted an order from General Canby to maintain the Central Lunatic Asylum, according to him. “The lunatic asylums are overflowing with patients.” The letter was written to create more wards to further segregate the African American insane from the white insane and a larger institution. This primary source suggests that overcrowding was a significant issue in many institutions across the nation. 

“Colored asylums” were extremely overcrowded, as described in General Canby’s letter to the governor, with 3 to 6 patients per bed. Most patients slept on pallets, straw mats, or even on the floor. Annual reports from the institutions described the conditions as severely congested and unfit for humane care. Due to the immense overcrowding, it often led to outbreaks of diseases like dysentery and the measles, furthering the notion that African Americans were housed under unsanitary conditions. In a transcript, Dr. J.J. DeLamater describes the conditions of the central state hospital, stating, “We have labored under many difficulties owing to the crowded condition of the wards (the occupants being twice as many as they were intended to accommodate).” [^note4] discussed these conditions with the board in charge of Central State Hospital. The racialization and the conditions of the wards were prevalent and being discussed by the physicians themselves, but the overcrowding stayed because of the large influx of African American patients. 

Patients in the segregated wards often suffered from medical and physical neglect compared to the treatment of Caucasian patients. A lot of this is due to medical racism and the discussion of civilized versus primitive viewpoints by white physicians. Some of the typical medical neglect issues included minimal access to physicians, reliance on restraints (shackles, cuffs, and strait jackets), and the use of sedatives more often. Similarly, black wards usually lacked essential items such as medicines, surgical care, clean bandages, and basic diagnostic tools. Proving the point that, according to Edwards, physicians “linked madness to emancipation and treatment was still used by the South.” This resulted in inadequate medical and hygienic care from staff and the board.

## Labor as a Cure

After emancipation, southern doctors and state officials introduced the idea that forced labor would be therapeutic for African American patients labeled as insane. The origins of this idea came from pre-emancipation and the idea that African Americans' bodies were suitable for manual labor. Across many institutions, including Central Lunatic Asylum, Georgia State Lunatic Asylum, and Taft State Hospital, black patients could be assigned different manual labor tasks. Primarily within the gender norms of society, men were often assigned to farm labor and construction. Black women were often assigned domestic duties, such as sewing, laundry, and kitchen work. Elodie Edwards describes a physician, John M. Galt's viewpoint about the inclusion of black insane patients. For Galt, "inclusion would make it possible for administrators to obtain a free labor force." Furthering the discussion that because the enslaved bodies could withstand manual labor during enslavement, their cure could be achieved through forced labor, which would return them to their "natural state." Describing the racialization of treatment, arguing that manual labor was African Americans' own type of therapy, predisposed by their bodies and lack of understanding of other therapeutic advances. In her book The Peculiar Institution and Making Modern Psychiatry, author Wendy Gonaver states that "farm labor or 'constant daily outdoor work' was to be the chief, if not the only means of cure," [^note4] Something she calls racial policing. Overall, white physicians saw manual labor as a means to continue laboring the once enslaved people, using pseudoscience seen before the Civil War to back up their claims. 

The description of insane African American patients by Southern doctors was usually racialized, seeing them as animal-like and needing physical restraint. This idea led to the argument that African Americans were too wild to be receptive to moral treatment, which led to forced labor discussed above. This led to stereotypes seeing African Americans as child-like and needing to be restrained.

## Women in the Asylum

Asylum administrators often focused on women's reproductive and sexual organs as products of insanity rather than discussing the effects of violence on the woman's body, and frequently ignored and suppressed the trauma endured during enslavement and systemic violence. Most of the time, when discussing black women's sexuality in the asylum's conversations, they would mostly center around marriage and motherhood. Wendy Gonaver, as mentioned above, describes the Eastern Lunatic Asylum as being "involved in regulating and interpreting the sexuality of its female patients, and that racial differentiation was an important part of this exercise." Reviewing primary sources, the author also discusses how a lot of the women admitted were diagnosed with mania, monomania, dementia, or moral insanity. Moral insanity piqued my interest, especially when looking into gender and women in asylums. Moral insanity can be described as a gendered diagnosis mostly confined to a woman who defied domestic roles. In reading these sources, it makes a lot of sense why women were given the tasks they were inside asylums, but, differing from Caucasian women, there is always a racial line drawn.
